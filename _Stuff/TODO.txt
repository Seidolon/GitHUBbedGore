UPDATED 6 of February 2015
1) Finish all the maps
2) Develop as best as I can the Story (English is not my first language, this will be very hard to do without grammar oddities)
3) Create some properly ACS in order to deactivate special effects et similae
4) Verify which skyboxes you need to use & remove unused
5) Verify which textures you need to use & remove unused
6) Fix Gargantuan Horror anims & decorate as best as I can
7) Create new HELP lumps for in-game explanations
8) Take a look if there are more effects to implement (something like Brutal fight feelings) or to remove (maybe the Cold Breath if laggin' will be excessive)
9) Create properly KSSC-USDF dialogue coherent to Story development
10) Try to find some more laughing voice acts, because all 3 classes have the same ones (anybody could help? Okulo are you here? :) )
11) Implement more versatile SNDSEQ & take a look to SNDINFO if something is not missed/conflicted
12) Implement 4:3 compatible graphics
13) Add newly/recolored skins to classes (but this isn't mandatory)
14) Try to find/create some better fonts
15) Test all 2d/3d actors implemented and see which are to fix/create/remove
